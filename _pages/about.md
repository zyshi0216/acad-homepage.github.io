# üë§ Biographies
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Shaanxi Province, China in 2001. During the year 2018 to 2022, I was pursuing my Bachelor's Degree at Xi'an Jiaotong University City College. During the years 2022 to 2025, I am pursuing a master's degree in Electronic Science and Technology at Northwestern Polytechnical University.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My **research interest** includes: Deep Learning, Machine Learning, UAV, Deep Reinforcement Learning, Intelligent Agent Collaborative Control, Signal Processing, Mathematical Modeling etc. 
I have published more than 10 papers in related academic fields.(SCI, EI, CSCD, etc)
([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iizm6rEAAAAJ&hl=en))

- In this paper, a wearable device is designed for table tennis players. It enables the recognition and evaluation of athletes' professional movement skills. It is mainly based on pattern recognition technology to realise the recognition of athletes' movement skills, and at the same time assesses athletes' movement skills based on a hierarchical evaluation system. It uses artificial intelligence technology to achieve the functions of monitoring recognition and skill assessment of athletes' motor skills.
